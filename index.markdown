# Collectie van de Gentenaar: Gentse rol van het wc

	Bringin heritage closer to the people.
An installation interpreting images from [Collectie van de Gentenaar](https://www.collectie.gent/).

The installation places images on a unique timeline, where each image is semantically connected one way or the other.

This timeline is then printed on toilet paper.

_That's about as close as it gets to the people._
