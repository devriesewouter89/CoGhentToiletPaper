# template matching

    "hi chatgpt
    I need to align toilet paper based on the notches in the paper to two parallel lines. I want to use a camera and a machine learning model. Yet I don't know which kind of model to use, do you have a suggestion how to detect notches in paper?"
> "Hello! One approach you could take to detect the notches in the toilet paper using a camera and machine learning model is to use a computer vision technique called template matching. This involves creating a template image of a single notch and then using this template to search for instances of the notch in an input image. 
> 
> To create the template image, you can simply take a picture of a single notch using the camera. You will then need to pre-process the template image by converting it to grayscale and possibly applying some image filtering to improve the contrast and remove noise.
>
> To search for instances of the notch in the input image, you can use a technique called convolution to slide the template image over the input image and compare the template to each subregion of the input image. You can then use a metric to determine how closely the template matches the subregion, and if the match is above a certain threshold, you can consider the subregion to contain a notch.
