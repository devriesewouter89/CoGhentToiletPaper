# paper flow

## steppers + camera

template matching
    => threshold + move away first before deciding to look again
need for light underneath paper to have enough contrast
work with region of interest: when does the paper leave or enter the region of interest?
    
needed to alter i2c address (by soldering a short circuit connection on pads)

## suction

fan beneath the paper
problem: turbulent air, not with prototype, yet with final version ==> no major issue

## angle 

I wanted a steep angle, for a certain visual appeal.
problem was that it tore the paper at the notches (it is intended for this of course...). So I had to make the angle less steep and make sure no sharp edges were in the path (smooth sanding to the rescue)
