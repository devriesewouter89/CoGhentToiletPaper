## Getting the data and preparing it

- initial plan: Nvidia Jetson, yet shortage, had an RPi 4 around.

## insert paper roll


## paper gets sucked down with the fan

## two steppers to roll off the paper

- notice: had to sand of all hard corners & align the height of all different parts, so the corner the paper took was not too steep. otherwise the paper would get torn apart.

## When to stop rolling?

## Drawing via Axidraw Mini

## drawing + markers +  toilet paper

- fonts: single line fonts necessary
- ink flows: need to take into account not using small text
- markers: need soft tips (not tearing the paper) + 

## the physical setup
